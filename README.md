# Folded_Cascode_Amplilfier_Project
This repo contains the report submitted for the final project of my Analog Integrated Circuits class, Spring 2017. In this project, I designed a folded cascode amplifier using Cadence Virtuoso. The amplifier had to meet specifications for supply voltage, load capacitance, gain, slew rate, phase margin, and power consumption.
